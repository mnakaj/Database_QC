# Database Quality Check

Please run formatting and reasonability checks to data submissions by submitting a csv file to following address: 

- Website for submission: [https://databaseqc.shinyapps.io/submission/](https://databaseqc.shinyapps.io/submission/) 

- Document with how tests check reasonability can be found [here](https://github.com/mnakaj/Database_QC/blob/master/Reasonability%20Tests/reasonability_tests.md). 

- All format-checking functions can be found [here](https://github.com/mnakaj/Database_QC/blob/master/App-1/funcs.R).

- Codes for countries and Koppen climates in this database can be found [here](https://github.com/mnakaj/Database_QC/tree/master/App-1/Data).

- You can use [this](https://github.com/mnakaj/Database_QC/blob/master/publication2.csv) example csv file to see what type of outputs are expected.

### Notes: 
To come: 

- Air movement preference function has been updated to check against air velocity instead of air temperature. This needs to be changed in the reasonability document.
